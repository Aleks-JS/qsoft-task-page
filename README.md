# Description of the task

During the test task, you need to implement the following points:

Write semantic and valid HTML markup for the entire page (using BEM methodology);
To style the section "Our partners" (ie apply the styles to the markup described in paragraph 1). Styling should be done using flexbox. The layout should be fluid and should be displayed correctly at resolutions of 1280px or more. There is no need to describe element rebuilds and additional styling for lower resolutions.

We draw your attention once again that all other sections of the page, except for "Our partners", do not need to be stylized!

Links to any pictures from the Internet can be used as images for products.

The task must be completed in an online platform for storing the code (for example, CodePen or CodeSandbox).
